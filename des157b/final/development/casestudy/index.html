                    <li>I wanted the platform to have a modern chic inspired by Asian Legacy Library</li>
                    <li>Swell Gallery 3D gave me the inspiration for the panels which would initiate the forms</li>
                    <li>It should feel as though you're interacting with a comic, manga, or painting</li>

            <h1>Visual</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>I wanted to atmosphere to reflect Buddhust Zen gardens. I sought to reflect this by prioritizing black, white, and green as the central colors</li>
                    <li>For title fonts I used a script font to match scrolls.</li>
                    <li>The font for text was Eurostile which was made to match futuristic/contemporary styles.</li>
                    <li>Peers suggested to make the design more culturally unique so I implemented a greeting screen that says "Nyob Zoo" which simply means hello in Hmong</li>

            <ul>
                <li>The left portion was dedicated to the menu and the slide for characters for indicating which panel you were on: food, art, war, or ghosts</li>
                <li>I love illustrating characters so they were created as visual guidance</li>
                <li>Nearly every element has an encoded animation for fading in and out when clicked or on hover for a natural and seamless experience</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>The project went through MASSIVE changes</li>
                    <li>Originally had three separate web pages</li>
                    <li>Extremely empty at first (where most of the user feedback went to) so the implementation of illustrations and the left portion for navigation filled the gaps</li>
                    <li>I got stuck then went back to step one by reverse engineering the Back4App Exercises</li>
